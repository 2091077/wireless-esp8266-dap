## Link your board

1. WIFI

The default connected WIFI SSID is `DAP` , password `12345678`

You can change `WIFI_SSID` and ` WIFI_PASS` in [wifi_configuration.h](main/wifi_configuration.h)

2. Debugger

- SWD

| SWD            |        |
|----------------|--------|
| SWCLK          | GPIO5  |
| SWDIO          | GPIO4  |
| LED\_CONNECTED | GPIO2  |
| LED\_RUNNING   | GPIO15 |
| TVCC           | 3V3    |
| GND            | GND    |

- JTAG

| JTAG               |         |
|--------------------|---------|
| TCK                | GPIO5   |
| TMS                | GPIO4   |
| TDI                | GPIO13  |
| TDO                | GPIO12  |
| nTRST \(optional\) | GPIO0\* |
| nRESET             | GPIO14  |
| LED\_CONNECTED     | GPIO2   |
| LED\_RUNNING       | GPIO15  |
| TVCC               | 3V3     |
| GND                | GND     |

You can modify these pin definitions in [DAP_config.h](components/DAP/config/DAP_config.h)

> Tips: Try to avoid using `GPIO0`(working mode switch) and `GPIO16`(RTC)

## Build

1. Get ESP8266 RTOS Software Development Kit

See: [ESP8266_RTOS_SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK "ESP8266_RTOS_SDK")

2. Build & Flash

Build with ESP-IDF build system.
More information can be found at the following link: [Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html "Build System")

The following example shows a possible way to build on Windows:

```bash
# Build
python ./idf.py build
# Flash
python ./idf.py -p /dev/ttyS5 flash
```

> We also provided sample firmware quick evaluation. See [Releases](https://github.com/windowsair/wireless-esp8266-dap/releases)


## Usage

1. Get USBIP project

- Windows: [usbip-windows](https://github.com/george-hopkins/usbip-windows "usbip-windows") . Or you can find it already built here: https://github.com/barbalion/usbip-win-client
- Linux: Distributed as part of the kernel

2. Start esp8266 and connect it to the device to be debugged

3. Connect it with usbip:

```bash
.\usbip.exe -D -a <your-esp8266-ip-address>  1-1
```

If all goes well, you should see your device connected.

## Develop

> Credits to:

> - https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5 for CMSIS


In this repo you can find the complete implementation of the USB protocol stack including USB-HID, WCID, WinUSB. Although WinUSB-based mode currently does not work on USBIP :disappointed_relieved: . They are very easy and can help you quickly build your own DAP on other hardware platforms.


Currently using USB-HID for transmission is still slightly slower, If you have any ideas, welcome:

- [New pull](https://github.com/windowsair/wireless-esp8266-dap/pulls)


### Issue

2-4

Due to the limitation of USB-HID (I'm not sure if this is a problem with USBIP or Windows), now each URB packet can only reach 255 bytes (About 1MBps bandwidth), which has not reached the upper limit of ESP8266 transmission bandwidth.

I now have an idea to construct a Man-in-the-middle between the two to forward traffic, thereby increasing the bandwidth of each transmission.

1-31

At present, the adaptation to WCID, WinUSB, etc. has all been completed. However, when transmitting data on the endpoint, we received an error message from USBIP. This is most likely a problem with the USBIP project itself.

Due to the completeness of the USBIP protocol document, we have not yet understood its role in the Bulk transmission process, which may also lead to errors in subsequent processes.

We will continue to try to make it work on USB HID. Once the USBIP problem is solved, we will immediately transfer it to work on WinUSB
